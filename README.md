  ✅ SQL Analytics: Wrote 28 beginner → advanced SQL queries (CRUD, joins, window functions, CTEs, recursive queries).
  
  ✅ Power BI Dashboard: Built a multi-page interactive dashboard:
  
  Overview (KPIs, map, delay trends)
  
  Route Performance (delay ranking, time slots)
  
  Trip Analytics (severity, running totals)
  
  Driver & Vehicle (performance ranking)
  
  Passenger Feedback (ratings, satisfaction)
  
  Tech Stack:
  Python · PostgreSQL · SQL · Power BI
  
  Outcome:
  📊 Actionable insights into delays, passenger satisfaction, and driver/route performance for better city transport planning.
