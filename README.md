## 🚀 Projects 

📊 **Placement Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Tech Stack:** Python | Scikit-learn | Flask | HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**Project Overview**

This project predicts whether a student will be placed based on their CGPA and IQ using a machine learning model. It includes a complete ML pipeline, from data processing to deployment using Flask and a simple web interface.

**Features**

**Machine Learning Pipeline**

Performed data exploration, preprocessing, and feature scaling using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

**Model Training**

Trained a Logistic Regression model to classify placement status, achieving high accuracy.

**Backend Integration**

Developed a Flask REST API to serve the model for real-time predictions.

**Frontend Interface**

Created a clean and responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that sends user input to the backend and displays predictions dynamically.

**How to Run**

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/placement-prediction.git
cd placement-prediction

2.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the Flask app:
python app.py

4.Open your browser and go to:

📊 **T20 Cricket World Cup Data Analysis & Dashboard**

**Objective:**

This project is an end-to-end data analytics case study focused on the T20 Cricket World Cup. It involves a full pipeline from raw data processing to creating an interactive, insight-driven dashboard. The goal was to transform complex cricket statistics into actionable insights about player and team performance.

**Key Technologies:**

Python (Pandas): Used for data cleaning, transformation, and creating a structured dataset from multiple raw CSV files. The entire ETL process is documented in a Jupyter Notebook.
Power BI: Employed for data modeling, creating a star schema, and developing a wide range of custom DAX measures and calculated columns.
DAX: Utilized to compute critical cricket metrics such as Batting Average, Strike Rate, Bowling Economy, and Dot Ball percentage.

**Project Deliverables:**

A clean, structured dataset ready for analysis.
An interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore player and team performance with dynamic filters.
The entire project, including the Jupyter Notebook, DAX formulas, and the Power BI file, is available in its dedicated repository.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

Data Wrangling, ETL, Data Modeling, Business Intelligence, Data Visualization, and Proficiency in Python, Pandas, Power BI, and DAX.
